            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE unhappy Contentions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which have now broken the <hi>Church</hi> into ſo many <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> began firſt about <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> A ſlight quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel in outward Appearance. But the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> hath told us, <hi>that a little fire kindleth a great quantity of Fuell.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57475:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> Jam. 3. 5. And this Age hath found it too true. The ſame ſpirit of Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which began at theſe dry leaves, or <hi>Chips of Diſcipline,</hi> as they ſeemed unto moſt at the firſt, invading by Degrees the ſolide Timber, and ſetting the whole wood in a flame. Great Differences have aroſe about theſe ſmall matters. And we have at length almoſt lost the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> through our eager and unſeaſonable contending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Circumſtantialls.</hi> The <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> indeed, with much confidence and Clamour, lay the Blame of theſe Diviſions upon the Rigour of their <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,</hi> in requiring an exact obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and preſſing too hard upon tender Conſciences. I could heartily wiſh, that ſome of Them who pretend ſo much to this Tenderneſs, and are ſo ſenſible of the leaſt Burden bound by the Hand of <hi>Authority,</hi> had Conſciences of a more even Temper, and a more conſtant Size<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But it is ſtrange to me, to ſee them contract and dilate their Conſciences at pleaſure,
<pb facs="tcp:57475:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> according to the Difference of Objects, (like the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old, who <hi>ſtrained at Gnats, and ſwallowed Camels)</hi> at the ſame time ſcrupling at ſmall <hi>Duties,</hi> and ſwallowing down great <hi>Sins;</hi> and making diſobedience to <hi>Mans</hi> lawes, one of the beſt Characters of <hi>Gods</hi> Servants, as if the fifth Commandement were abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated among the <hi>Jewiſh Ceremonies;</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian liberty</hi> conſiſted in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Thoſe whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath ſet over us. Would to <hi>God</hi> they would at length lay aſide their Prejudices and Paſſions, and ſhew themſelves as zealous for the Peace of the <hi>Church,</hi> as they have been for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of <hi>Parties.</hi> Which I hope they will do, when they conſider ſeriouſly with themſelves,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the ſmaller the Ceremony is, which they contend about, in oppoſition to lawfull <hi>Authority,</hi> the Diſobedience is the greater, becauſe in a matter of ſo eaſy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; and conſequently, the Schiſme is more Groundleſſe, and the offender more Guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> that theſe unhappy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
<pb facs="tcp:57475:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> among the <hi>Guides</hi> of Religion, whether True or pretended ones, have already produced moſt ſad effects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>People;</hi> whilſt ſome have been miſled into the groſſeſt errours, and others have thought themſelves the onely <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> by confederating in a <hi>Schiſme:</hi> ſome, diſtracted amongſt the multiplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of opinions, and walking uncertainly after contrary calls; others amazed, and at a ſtand; and too many, willing to perſwade themſelves, that Religion it ſelfe is ſcarce worth the ſeeking, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that the experience of theſe late years hath ſufficiently taught us, there's no hope of unity in the <hi>Church,</hi> without <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity in the Service of <hi>God,</hi> and the Rituals of our Religion. Severall <hi>Churches</hi> indeed, who are Independent of each other, (as the <hi>States</hi> are wherein they are ſeated, being ruled by different Lawes and Governours) have, and may vary in Ceremonialls, without breach of Peace. But to ſuffer every private Perſon to follow his
<pb facs="tcp:57475:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> own fancy in matters of Religion, or the Dictates of ſome idolized <hi>Teacher,</hi> whom he hath choſen for his ſpirituall Guide, in oppoſition to the Government of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> wherein he lives, is the ready way to bring in an Infinity of Schiſmes, and confound all.</p>
            <p>A ſmall Gap, or two, in a Hedge ſeems inconſiderable at f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rſt; and the thin, tender Rind of an Apple ſeems as inconſiderable a Fence to the Fruit which it incloſeth: yet frequent experience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructeth us, that the neglect of the one hath made way, both for the Cattle within to ſtray forth, and looſe Themſelves, and periſh in their wandrings; and for ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Cattle, to breake in, and devoure the Field. And the paring away of ſome ſmall Portion of the other, hath cauſed the whole Fruit, firſt to diſcolour, and then to putrify. Such an Hedge, ſuch a Rinde, is the Order and Diſcipline of the <hi>Church,</hi> which conſiſts in <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> and <hi>externall obſervances;</hi> the leaſt breach wherein, though not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable at the firſt making, yet waxeth
<pb facs="tcp:57475:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> larger by inſenſible Degrees, and at length eats out the very Subſtance of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; as the late Times have evidenced to our Smart and Shame.</p>
            <p>Now to cloſe up theſe Differences in the matter of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which firſt occaſioned them, I humbly conceive it the moſt faire and rationall way (ſeeing that holy <hi>Scripture</hi> ſaith little, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Them in particular) to make an impartiall ſearch into the Records of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and the Judgement of thoſe neighbouring <hi>Churches</hi> of ours in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> which generally paſſe amongſt us under the Title of <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> or <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi> For none of the contending parties, who pretend to any <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Modeſty or Ingenuity, will, I preſume, diſavow either of Theſe, to both which they make an open claime. Seeing They pretend all to follow primitive patterns, and the example of thoſe <hi>Neighbour Churches</hi> which have purged themſelves from the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, and Corruptions of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> Yea they frequently make the pretended <hi>Conformity</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:57475:6"/> Theſe, a ſpecious plea fortheir own <hi>Non-Conformity</hi> to the Lawes and Orders of their <hi>Mother Church.</hi> Now it is the Deſigne of this ſmall Treatiſe, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Conſonancy of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Englands</hi> Judgement and Practice unto Both theſe, in the Geſture of <hi>kneeling</hi> at the Holy <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> A Geſture which hath been much ſcrupled at by ſome, and abſolutely cryed down by others, as Superſtitious, if not Idolatrous; as quite contrary to the nature of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall Supper, which it attends, and to the Practice of our Saviour, and his Apoſtles at the firſt inſtitution. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon what Grounds theſe Clamours have been raiſed, whether true or miſtaken, let the indifferent <hi>Reader</hi> Judge, upon the Survey of theſe Papers; wherein I have taken ſome Paines, to track the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of the <hi>Churches</hi> Practice in all Ages and Places, as farre as the light of <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and my ſlender Reading could diſcover. Withall, I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, to cleare the Miſtakes of Thoſe, who have ſo eagerly ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb facs="tcp:57475:7"/> againſt <hi>kneeling,</hi> whilſt they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for <hi>ſitting</hi> at the receiving of this <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I have made choice of This, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſome other Ceremonies that are queſtioned, becauſe it is of a more generall Concernment. The <hi>Surplice,</hi> and <hi>Croſſe</hi> in <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tbers that are ſtumbled at, concerne the <hi>Clergy</hi> alone, who are injoyned to uſe them in their Miniſtry. But as for <hi>knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> at the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> it concernes all alike, the <hi>People</hi> as well as the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> who are Both commanded to uſe it, and in caſe of <hi>Non-Conformity</hi> debar themſelves of the many and great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of ſo <hi>Bleſſed</hi> a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and ſo exclude themſelves from the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> in the higheſt Myſtery of our Religion. Now if this ſmall <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> prove ſo happy, through <hi>Gods Bleſſing,</hi> to ſcatter the Prejudices of ſome, and confirme the waverings of others, and ſo become a meanes of contributing ought towards the Peace of the <hi>Church,</hi> I have my much wiſht
<pb facs="tcp:57475:7"/> for end; and ſhall have juſt cauſe of joyning my <hi>Thanks</hi> and <hi>Prayſes,</hi> with Theirs who receive any Benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, unto the great God of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the choice of the <hi>Perſon,</hi> to whoſe Protection I have made bold to recommend ſo inconſiderable a Treatiſe; the very Title in the Front of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle will, I hope, either defend or excuſe me to the World, though the Diſcourſe it ſelfe be unworthy of his Acceptance. For the very name of <hi>Patron</hi> is a ſufficient Evidence of my Obligations, and may justly claime whatſoever I can do in this kind, as a Teſtimoniall of my Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; which I muſt ſhew as I can, when I cannot as I would. And your Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, I well know, looketh not ſo much at the Greatneſs of the Gift, as the good will of the <hi>Giver.</hi> Who, if God pleaſe to grant him life and leiſure anſwerable to his Deſires, will be ready to ſecond this with ſome farther proofs of his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance. But this is not all. Your known zeale for maintaining the good Orders
<pb facs="tcp:57475:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the <hi>Church,</hi> with your exemplary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence at the publick Service, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, at this holy <hi>Sacrament;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that Influence which your Suffrage and Authority had, in reviving the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Law for the Geſture of <hi>kneeling</hi> thereat, might juſtly challenge this Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at my hands, though I had no other Reaſon or Relation.</p>

            <p>Now, this Table-Geſture the <hi>Jews</hi> had learned of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> who for many years had lorded it over them, and taught them this among other Cuſtoms. To ſay nothing of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> under whoſe Dominion they had lived for many years before, upon their Return from the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Captivity; for they alſo uſed the ſame
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57475:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> Poſture at their Feaſts, and Banquets, as we read, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 1. 5, 6.

            <p>But if any deſire to ſee more touching the uſe of this Table-Geſture, among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> they may pleaſe to conſult the following paſſages in the Hiſtory of the Goſpel. For <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. See <hi>Mat</hi> 9, 10. <hi>and</hi> 22. 10. <hi>and</hi> 26. 7. <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 37. <hi>and</hi> 22. 27. <hi>and Jo.</hi> 6. 11. For <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 35. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 37. <hi>and Chap.</hi> 14. 10. <hi>and</hi> 17. 7. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>and</hi> 21. 20.</p>
            <p>It is probable indeed, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> uſed the ſame Geſture at the Celebration of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> which they had uſed at the eating of the <hi>Paſſover;</hi> Firſt becauſe we read that this Sacrament
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57475:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> was inſtituted at the Cloſe of the Feaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the food was quite taken away from the Table, <hi>viz.</hi> at the end of the laſt Courſe. So St. <hi>Matthew</hi> tells us <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>as they were eating,</hi> Jeſus <hi>took Bread, and bleſſed it,</hi> &amp;c. St <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith the ſame, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. 22. with whom we may compare St. <hi>Luke, Chap.</hi> 22. 15, 19. Secondly, becauſe the Evangeliſt St. <hi>John</hi> tels us of himſelf, <hi>that he leaned on the Boſome of Jeſus,</hi> a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Judas</hi> went out. <hi>John</hi> 13. 23. with chap. 21. 20, 24. Now, that <hi>Judas,</hi> before he went out to betray his <hi>Maſter,</hi> received the <hi>Sacrament</hi> with the reſt of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> is not only the Judgment of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> (expreſt in the Exhortation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Communion)</hi> but the general opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion alſo of the ancient <hi>Fathers;</hi> Both grounding their Judgment, as I ſuppoſe, on thoſe words of St. <hi>Luke. Ch.</hi> 22. 19, 20, 21. Where the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> tells us, that after our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> had delivered the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in both kinds to his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded theſe words, <hi>Behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me, is with me on the Table.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Probable I ſay, not certain, becauſe St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> both tell us that this <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> was inſtituted after <hi>Supper.</hi> The
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57475:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> informing us, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> took the <hi>Sacramental Cup,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>after Supper:</hi> which circumſtance the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> alſo thought fit to remember us of, where he particularly relates the order, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Inſtitution, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 25. And St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, that Supper being end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, our <hi>Saviour</hi> aroſe from the Table, and waſhed his <hi>Diſciples</hi> feet, and afterwards ſet himſelf down again. So that, for ought is expreſt to the contrary, he might poſſibly vary his Poſture, and his <hi>Diſciples</hi> with him, when he celebrated that <hi>Goſpel-myſtery,</hi> which he then inſtituted, in the room of the <hi>Jewiſh Paſsover,</hi> eſpecially when the Text ſaith, that he began the Celebration thereof with a new Benediction; which clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by comparing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 26, 27, 28. with <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 17. 20.</p>
            <p>Thus the Scripture leaveth us ſomwhat in the dark, as touching the Geſture which our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> uſed at the firſt Inſtitution: which doubtleſs it would never have done, if the Geſture then uſed had been oblieging to poſterity; whereas we find not there mentioned ſo much as a certain pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to imitate, much leſs any Precept to bind us unto Obedience. Now, in ſuch a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57475:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> caſe as this, I know no better rule to guide our Practice by, then the examples of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> which in all reaſon ſhould beſt know what the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> both did and taught, and therefore is to be looked upon, as the beſt keeper and witneſs of what they left us, as the moſt faithful Depoſitary of their Principles, and the moſt authentick Directreſs of our Practice. Now, if we pleaſe to conſult the moſt ancient Records of thoſe early Times, this we ſhall find.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Laodicea</hi> (which was ſomwhat ancienter then that of <hi>Nice,</hi> and whoſe <hi>Canons</hi> were afterwards received into the <hi>Code</hi> of the Church-Univerſal) ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely forbiddeth the poſture of lying on Couches in the <hi>Church,</hi> at the Celebration of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> or the feaſts of Charity which accompanied it.</p>
            <p>The words of the Twenty eighth <hi>Canon</hi> of that <hi>Council,</hi> are theſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; that is, <hi>The Feaſts of Charity are not to be kept in the Lords houſe, or in the Church, neither may ye eat, or make Couches in the Houſe of God.</hi> The ſame Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> afterwards forbidden to be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57475:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> uſed, in the very ſame words, by a great Council of <hi>Greek Biſhops</hi> aſſembled in <hi>Trullo,</hi> and that under the pain of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz. Can.</hi> 74. Both Councils, as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, either conceiving this Geſture not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent enough for ſo venerable a Myſtery, or (at leaſt) much ſubject to abuſe, which I the rather think, becauſe I find ſome ſuch like abuſe crept into the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> in thoſe early days, which the <hi>Apostle</hi> alſo ſharply taxeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 22. 29. <hi>Have ye not houſes to eat, and to drink in? Or deſpiſe ye the Church of God? he that eateth, and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lords Body.</hi> Where he blames them for uſing the ſame freedom, and bold carriage at the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> and the Feaſts of Charity, which wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on it, as at their own ordinary meals, thereby making no difference between their Corporal and their Spiritual Repaſt; for which cauſe theſe <hi>Agapae,</hi> or <hi>Feaſts of Charity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> were afterwards left off, when the Abuſe began to ſpread ſo far, as univerſally to prevail.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for <hi>Sitting,</hi> this Geſture which our <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> ſo much contend for, as the moſt proper for the Holy <hi>Communion;</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:57475:14"/> it was ſo far from being appropriated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to of old, that (upon the beſt ſearch I could make) I have not found it uſed at all in <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service,</hi> except at the reading of the <hi>Leſſons,</hi> and the hearing of the <hi>Sermon.</hi> For <hi>Juſtine</hi> Martyr implies that during this part of the <hi>Service,</hi> the <hi>People</hi> ſate; when he thus informs us concerning the <hi>Christian</hi> Aſſemblies of his time (ſuch at leaſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was acquainted.) After the reading of the <hi>Leſſons,</hi> and the Exhortatory <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>, that is, <hi>we riſe up altogether, and ſend up our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> Apol. 2. But whether, or no this was permitted to the <hi>People</hi> in all places, I much queſtion: partly, becauſe <hi>Optatus</hi> tells us, <hi>Populus in Eccleſiâ ſedendi licentiam non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,</hi> that is, <hi>the People is not licenſed to ſit in the Church;</hi> partly, becauſe in moſt, if not all the <hi>Eaſtern Churches</hi> at this day, the <hi>People</hi> have no ſeats at all allowed them in the <hi>Church,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew anon. However, this is clear enough, that after the firſt <hi>Service</hi> was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the <hi>Catechumens,</hi> and ſome others diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, and the office of the <hi>Communion</hi> begun, the <hi>People</hi> never ſate, no not ſo much as in the Intervals of that <hi>Service.</hi> For firſt, the

               <hi>fatigaverit?</hi> That is, <q>The Geſture of ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting after Prayers, therefore deſerves to be reproved, becauſe it is uſed in the Idol-Temples. Add hereunto the Sin of Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, which the very Heathen, if they were wiſe, would take notice of: for it is irreverent to ſit in his preſence, whom Thou doſt highly honour, and regard. How much more irreligious is this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, in the ſight of the Living God, the Angel of Prayer yet ſtanding by, unleſs we think fit to upbraid God, that our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have tired us?</q> Where, in his men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the <hi>Angel of Prayer</hi> to ſtand by, he ſeems to allude to that Paſſage in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> chap. 1. 11. where we read, that the <hi>Angel Gabriel</hi> appeared to <hi>Zachary</hi> the <hi>Prieſt</hi> (as he was officiating in the Temple) ſtanding on the Right ſide of the Altar of Incenſe; or elſe, to that Viſion of Saint <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 8. 3, 4. Wherein he is ſaid to have ſeen an <hi>Angel</hi> ſtanding at the <hi>Altar,</hi> having a golden Cenſer, to whom there was much In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe given, that he ſhould offer it with the Prayers of all <hi>Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, as to the Geſture of <hi>Standing,</hi> there is more to be ſaid for it; for there be clear Teſtimonies of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> that this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57475:16"/> was the received Geſture at <hi>Divine Service</hi> for many Ages; eſpecially, on the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> and ſome other <hi>Solemn Feasts</hi> then cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated.</p>
            <p>But whereas ſome great Champions of the <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> have confidently affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there was no <hi>Kneeling</hi> at all, but <hi>Standing</hi> only uſed in the <hi>Church,</hi> from the year 150 to the year 1220. when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of <hi>P.

Firſt, if it could be made appear, it makes againſt all thoſe who ſit at the <hi>Communion,</hi> or at any other part of the Publick <hi>Service.</hi> But ſecondly, upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Examination, we ſhall find this Geſture of <hi>Standing</hi> not ſo generally uſed, as they would bear us in hand; whether we regard the parts of <hi>Divine Service,</hi> or the times and places in which it was performed. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> I am ſure, who is one of their prime Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, durſt not be ſo confident, but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly tells us, <hi>ut autem ſtantes in illis die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, &amp; omnibus Dominicis oremus, utrum ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ſervetur, ignoro:</hi> That is, <q>Whether this Cuſtom of Standing [between <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>

            <p>I ſhall endeavour therefore to lay down the Truth in this particular, as near as I can, out of the beſt <hi>Authors,</hi> I have met with; and then I ſhall ſhew how this ancient Cuſtom of Standing at <hi>Divine Service</hi> doth by no means prejudice the practice of our Church at this day, which is, to kneel at the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Communion.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57475:19"/> even in theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> parts. The Thirty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Turone</hi> begins thus: <hi>Sciendum eſt, quòd exceptis diebus Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicis, &amp; illis Feſtivitatibus, quibus &amp; uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſalis Eccleſia, ob recordationem Dominicae Reſurrectionis, ſolet ſtando orare,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <q>You are to know, that excepting the Lords Days, and thoſe Feſtivals on which the Univerſal Church, in memory of our Lords Reſurrection, is wont to pray ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> And <hi>Hugo de</hi> S. <hi>Vict.</hi> obſerves, that the <hi>People ſtood</hi> at Prayer, untill the Collect, <hi>Domine Deus Pater, qui nos ad princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>O Lord, our Heavenly Father, which hast ſafely brought us to the Beginning of this Day</hi> &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>When, and upon what Reaſons, this <hi>Geſture</hi> came afterwards to be left off in theſe <hi>Weſtern Parts,</hi> I cannot as yet learn. Whether it were changed into <hi>kneeling,</hi> as the more humble, and reverend Geſture; or that <hi>kneeling</hi> was taken up in oppoſition to the <hi>Greek Church</hi> (wherewith this of the <hi>Weſt</hi> was then at variance) which uſed ſtanding in <hi>Divine Service,</hi> and yet uſeth it: or, becauſe the Ground, and Motive thereof ceaſing in time <hi>(viz.</hi> The teſtifying of our <hi>Saviours Reſurrection</hi> to the Infidels) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming every day leſs preſſing, as the World came more, and more in to the Faith of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Geſture of <hi>ſtanding,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth thereon, vaniſhed by Degrees, and was alter'd into that of <hi>kneeling;</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not determine; but ſhall leave it unto thoſe who have read more, and can judge better.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add only three Teſtimonies, which the <hi>Adverſaries</hi> to <hi>kneeling</hi> at the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> urge in favour of their <hi>Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> and then examine briefly what ſtrength there lies in each of them. The firſt is taken
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57475:20" rendition="simple:additions"/> out of <hi>Juſtine Martyr,</hi> in the place forecited, at the latter end of his ſecond <hi>Apology;</hi> where, deſcribing the manner, and method of <hi>Divine Service</hi> at the publick Aſſemblies, he tells us, that after the <hi>Sermon</hi> was ended, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple roſe up altogether, and ſent up their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers unto God, which when they were finiſht, Bread and Wine (with water) were brought, or offer'd. Then the Biſhop in like manner ſendeth up Prayers, and Thanksgivings,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>with his utmoſt devotion, the People joyfully atteſting their conſent, by ſaying,</hi> Amen. <hi>Then diſtribution is made to every one of the Elements ſo conſecrated, or bleſt &amp;c.</hi> In which words, ſay they, there is not the leaſt mention of any alteration of the <hi>peoples Geſture</hi> to <hi>kneeling,</hi> after they once <hi>roſe</hi> up, upon the ending of the <hi>Sermon.</hi> To which I anſwer: Firſt, This is but a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Argument, and proves nothing. No change of <hi>Geſture</hi> is here mention'd, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none there was. Secondly, as there is no mention of changing their <hi>Geſture</hi> into <hi>kneeling,</hi> ſo (much leſs) of any change there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of into <hi>ſitting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which is now ſo eagerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for; for we uſe to riſe from our ſeats, that we may <hi>kneel</hi> to <hi>Prayers,</hi> but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57475:20"/> to ſit at them. Thirdly, I ſhall prove anon by ſufficient Witneſſes, that the <hi>People</hi> fell down, or kneeled at ſome part of the <hi>Communion-Service,</hi> and uſed a <hi>Geſture</hi> of <hi>Adoration,</hi> in the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Receiving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> is that of <hi>Dionyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Alex. in Euſeb. Eccleſ. Hiſt. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. Where writing to <hi>Xistus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> concerning one who deſired <hi>Rebaptization,</hi> becauſe he had been formerly baptized by the <hi>Hereticks</hi> in a wrong Form, with a <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> as he ſaid, full of <hi>Impiety,</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy;</hi> He tells <hi>Xiſtus,</hi> that he durſt not Rebaptize him, although troubled in mind about it, becauſe the <hi>Perſon</hi> ſo baptized by <hi>Hereticks</hi> had often <hi>communicated,</hi> heard the <hi>Euchariſtical Service</hi> in the Church, and ſaid <hi>Amen,</hi> with the Reſt, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that is, <hi>Standing at the Holy Table,</hi> and that he had reached forth his Hand to partake of the Holy Food. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Firſt, That the word [<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>] may well be rendred by <hi>juxta ſiſtere ſe,</hi> vel <hi>adeſſe,</hi> and ſo ſignifie rather his <hi>preſence at the holy Table,</hi> then his <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>Geſture. Ruffinus</hi> therefore rendreth it thus, <hi>Quòd tamdiu in Sacramentis nobiſcum particeps fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit; That he had been ſo long time Partaker</hi>

               <hi>with us in the Sacraments.</hi> And again, <hi>Neque audet ultra ad menſam Dominicam accedere; Neither dares he any more approach unto the Lords Table.</hi> Secondly, the <hi>Party</hi> might well <hi>ſtand</hi> near the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> at ſome part of the <hi>Prayers,</hi> and yet change his <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture</hi> in the Act of <hi>Receiving:</hi> Which that it was the Cuſtom, I ſhall ſhew anon.</p>
            <p>The third Teſtimony is that of <hi>Theodoret, Eccleſ: Hiſt. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 17. Where he brings in Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> thus ſpeaking to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> or rather thus admoniſhing him by his <hi>Deacon,</hi> when he was entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Chancel,</hi> to receive the <hi>Communion,</hi> which was allowed to the <hi>Clergy</hi> only, <hi>Exi, &amp; sta cum aliis laicis,</hi>

            <p n="9">9. The nature of the Service, if well conſidered, requires the moſt humble, and reverential Geſture. For in the receiving of this Holy <hi>Sacrament,</hi> we are made Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of all the <hi>Benefits</hi> of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Death, and Paſſion, which therein are conveyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and thereby applied. We therein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo offer up our ſelves, both Souls, and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, with all that we have, or are, unto <hi>God,</hi> in the nature of a Peace-offering, or Sacrifice of Thankſgiving, for the many
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57475:60" rendition="simple:additions"/> great unſpeakable Benefits, beſtowed upon us through <hi>Christ,</hi> when he offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto his <hi>Father</hi> a Propitiatory Sacrifice upon the Croſs. Therein we receive a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our Sins paſt; Power to ſubdue Corruptions, and overcome Temptations for the time to come; Peace of Conſcience ariſing from Both, and a certain Pledge of our Reſurrection to a Life Eternal. Do not all theſe, do not any of theſe, require as much Humility, as Thankfulneſs? And is it not fit to expreſs that Humility (eſpecially, in the <hi>Publick Service,</hi> where <hi>God</hi> is moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and requires us to honour him in the eyes of <hi>men)</hi> by the lowlieſt demeanour, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſhew, and teſtifie our inward Devotion? If we were to receive a Pardon, or any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable favour from an earthly <hi>Prince,</hi> we would not make the leaſt ſcruple to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it <hi>kneeling;</hi> but rather condemn any one of unſufferable Pride, and Arrogancy, Folly, and Ingratitude, who ſhould think much to uſe that humble Geſture. Nay, if we were but admitted to kiſs the <hi>Kings</hi> Hand, we would readily kneel to receive ſo eaſie, ſo ordinary a Favour. <hi>Children</hi> uſe the like Geſture, when they aske their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> Bleſſing; and when a <hi>Subject</hi> doth Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to his <hi>Prince,</hi> he performes it with
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57475:60" rendition="simple:additions"/> the ſame Reverence. Shall we then doubt, or deny to perform the ſame, when we receive a Pardon from the Great <hi>King</hi> of Heaven and Earth, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> ſealed unto us in this <hi>Sacrament?</hi> When we receive the Gift of Eternal Life, conveyed unto us by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of whom we are therein made Partakers? When alſo we do ſolemn homage unto our <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> by devoting our ſelves wholly to his Service, who once devoted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Sacrifice to <hi>God</hi> for our Salvation? Sure, there is ſtrength in this Argument, if either Reaſon, or Religion may be judge. For thus <hi>God</hi> himſelf argues with his <hi>People</hi> by the <hi>Prophet Malachi. A Son honoureth his Father, and a Servant his Maſter. If then I be a Father, where is mine honour? and if I be a Maſter, where is my fear? Ye ſay, the Table of the Lord is contemptible. And if ye offer the Blind for Sacrifice, is it not evil? And if ye offer the lame, and the ſick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy Governor. Will he be pleaſed with thee, or accept thy perſon, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts? Ye brought that which was torne, and the lame and the ſick. Thus ye brought an Offering; Should I accept this of your Hand, ſaith the Lord? I am a Great King, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, and my name is dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>

Now, the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which enjoyneth <hi>kneeling,</hi> openly declares her Judgment againſt the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration</hi> of the <hi>Hoaſt,</hi> which is grounded upon that Principle, or Suppoſall. Whereby all Scandall, and the very <hi>Appearance of evill,</hi> is quite taken away, whenas the ſame <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> which enjoynes the one, renounceth the other, as our <hi>Church</hi> doth in her 28. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle.</hi> When <hi>Naaman</hi> had openly profeſt that he would not ſacrifice to any <hi>God,</hi> but the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he was diſmiſt with a Bleſſing by the Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and had an implicite

The other Tribes were ſatisfied at the building of the great Altar by the Bankes of <hi>Jordan,</hi> when they heard the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of the <hi>Tribes</hi> of <hi>Ruben,</hi> and <hi>Gad,</hi> and the halfe <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> that they had not built it for ſacrifice to worſhip any <hi>falſe God</hi> by, or the <hi>true God</hi> in a Schiſmatical way; but meerly for a monument of Concord, &amp; equall <hi>priviledges</hi> in the ſervice of the ſame <hi>God.</hi> The <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> in <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtates</hi> time, and under the ten Perſecutions, would not ſo much as caſt a Graine of Incenſe into the fire which was made before an Idol, (no not to ſave their lives) becauſe it would have been looked upon and interpreted, as a divine, religious honour done to that Idol. Neither would they bow themſelves before the <hi>Romane-Eagles,</hi> the Enſignes of the Camp, for the ſame Reaſon. Yet the ſame <hi>Chriſtians</hi> made no ſcruple of lifting up their hands and eyes towards Heaven, when they prayed in the open fields (as that Legion of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Souldiers did (mentioned by <hi>Juſtin Martyr)</hi> which obtained raine for the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57475:87" rendition="simple:additions"/> Army of <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> in a time of great Diſtreſſe) not fearing thereby to ſcandalize the Heathen, and confirme them in their idolatrous worſhipping of the Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Moone and Stars; becauſe it was ſufficiently known unto the world, to whom they directed that bodily worſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> not to the Hoſt of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but to the Lord of Hoſts. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Church of England cannot be juſtly cenſured, for confirming the Romaniſts in the Belief of Tranſubſtantiation, and the ſuitable Practiſe of adoring the Hoaſt, becauſe ſhe hath profeſſedly condemned both that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and that Practiſe, and openly declared that ſhe directs not this Bodily worſhip of kneeling to the viſible ſignes in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, immediately, or indirectly, or any way whatſoever, (as it is commonly minced, and qualified with diſtinctions) but ſolely and immediately to God in Heaven. Yea I remember to have ſome where read, that the ſame primitive Chriſtians refuſed not to bow down and proſtrate themſeves before the Statues of the Emperours, becauſe it was reputed a civile honour, and ſo profeſt by themſelves. And though they were taxed by ſome of the Heathen for worſhipping of <hi>Ceres</hi> &amp; <hi>Bacchus,</hi> becauſe they adored at the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57475:88" rendition="simple:additions"/> receiving of the Bread, and Wine in the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> yet they conſtantly reteined the ſame Geſture, not thinking fit to alter it, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo groundleſſe a ſlander. Yea Mr <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> acknowledgeth, in his Epiſtle to the Church of England, That if among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> filth we find any good Thing, that we willingly receive, not as theirs, but as the Jewes did the holy Arke from the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines. For herein (ſaith he) it is true that is ſaid, The ſheep muſt not lay down her Fell, becauſe ſhe ſees the wolfe ſometimes clothed with it. And the Apoſtle hath taught us, that it is lawfull to eate that meat which hath been ſacrificed to Idols, asking no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion for Conſcience ſake. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 25, 27.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57475:92" rendition="simple:additions"/> when they receive it? They uſe not to fit bare when invited to the <hi>Table</hi> of their <hi>Superiours.</hi> Why uſe they this Reverence, when invited to their Elder <hi>Brother,</hi> and <hi>Coheire?</hi> This evidently ſhews they make a difference between their Carriage at a common, and this holy <hi>Table.</hi> Let them then but conforme their knees unto their Heads, by a proportionable Reverence, and the matter is at an end. As for croſſing the Aſſurance of our Coheir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſure the contrary experience of thoſe many, who receive it keeling, is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Argument, that the Aſſurance of our Privileges, and intereſt in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> may very well conſiſt with this lowly poſture; and is ſo farre from being croſſed, that it is furthered thereby. There is no Duty exempted from <hi>Humility,</hi> which is ſo neceſſary to ballance all our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>

But ſuppoſe that which the objection would have; That the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted here in the <hi>Church Militant</hi> repreſents the <hi>Supper of the Lambe</hi> in the <hi>Church Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant.

And therefore if we will do the will of <hi>God</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi> as it is done by theſe <hi>Saints</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> we muſt imitate them in this alſo, by uſing the like <hi>Geſture.</hi> For Saint <hi>John</hi> tels us, that <hi>the</hi> 24. <hi>Elders</hi> (who repreſent the chief Heads, or Paſtours of the Church) <hi>fall down before him that ſate on the Throne, and worſhip him that liveth for ever and ever, and caſt their Crowns before the Throne.

               <p n="1">1. It hath been, I hope, ſufficiently proved, that kneeling is moſt ſutable to the Duty performed at the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> and therefore agreeable to the Law of <hi>God,</hi> who enjoynes that Duty. They are but ill judges of Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, who ſo far forget Themſelves, and their Duty, as to approach unto <hi>Gods Table</hi> (where he is ſo eminently preſent, and proffers ſuch high, undeſerved Favours to his unworthy Servants) with the ſame Boldneſſe, as to their own, or that of their Equals. The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in all Ages, hath thought it undecent to receive the <hi>Sacrament</hi> with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Geſture than that which they uſed at their publick Prayers, at which ſitting was never uſed. Now <hi>Chriſtian</hi> modeſty and humility ſhould prevaile with us ſo far, as not to cenſure and condemne
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57475:95" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſo generall a Practiſe, but ſubmit our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to that of the <hi>Church.</hi> But the great Stumbling-block of the <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> in this Particular, is this, that they look upon the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> as a common Feaſt amongſt <hi>Equals,</hi> not as a Dole to poore <hi>Beggars:</hi> upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as their <hi>Brother,</hi> not as their <hi>Lord:</hi> upon themſelves, as <hi>Gueſts,</hi> not as <hi>Suppliants;</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the <hi>Altar</hi> of Worſhip, whilſt they are too intent upon the <hi>Table</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why may not a <hi>private</hi> worſhip, be uſed during the <hi>Publick?</hi> ſome <hi>kneeling,</hi> whilſt others <hi>ſtand,</hi> or <hi>ſit?</hi> If the contrary hold good, no man may kneel, when he firſt comes into the Church, whilſt others per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps are ſitting at the Hearing of the Leſſons. No Preacher may kneel, when he enters the Pulpit, whilſt the People in the meane time are buſied in ſinging of the Pſalme. Yea <hi>Hannah</hi> ſhall be condemned for praying at the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> the Place of publick worſhip, when ſhe privately importuned <hi>God</hi> to look on her Affliction, and give her a Son. It appeares by King <hi>Solomons</hi> Prayer at the <hi>Dedication</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57475:95" rendition="simple:additions"/> the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> put up their private occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall petitions in the houſe of Prayer. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 38, 39. 41, 43. S. <hi>Pauls</hi> practiſe ſhews the ſame. <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 17. When the <hi>Prieſt</hi> offered up the Sacrifices (which were of ſeverall ſorts) the ſeverall Parties which brought them, offered up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all their particular Devotions, whether Confeſſion, Prayer, or Praiſe, according to the nature of the Sacrifice, and the condition of the Supplicant. When <hi>Zacharias</hi> offered Incenſe in the <hi>Temple,</hi> the <hi>People</hi> were praying without; and, for ought the Text tels us, every one ſingly by himſelf, during the time of the publick Service, which was performed in the name and behalfe of the whole. This alſo condemnes the practiſe of all thoſe who ſtand at the receiving of the Communion (as many of the <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> did, and many whole Churches now do, whom they will be loth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne) whilſt the maine of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, who yet keep their Seats, or are newly returned to them, are imployed in meditation, reading, or ſinging of Pſalmes. The like is done in greater Congregations, where they ſit one Company after another.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57475:96" rendition="simple:additions"/> So that what ever Geſture is uſed, there muſt be place left for private Devotions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As for the meaneſs of the <hi>Elements,</hi> which is pretended in prejudice of knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the Receipt of them it is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument which ſavours of too much folly and profaneneſſe. For if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Elements</hi> in themſelves, they are the Beſt, the moſt neceſſary, and the moſt excellent of Foods; <hi>Bread,</hi> the ſtaffe of life, and ſtrengthner of mans Heart; <hi>Wine</hi> the chief Refreſher, and Reviver of the Spirits. But if we look on them in their uſe and Deſignation, (as they are to be looked on in the <hi>Sacrament)</hi> they are called by our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelfe (who beſt knew what they were) his own <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> that is, ſacred, and efficacious Inſtruments of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> unto us, with all the vertues, &amp; merits of his <hi>Death</hi> &amp; <hi>Paſſion.</hi> And, whoever call, or eſteem ſuch as theſe, mean and vile, are moſt unworthy <hi>Blaſphemers,</hi> who as little deſerve to receive benefit from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as they regard his Ordinances.</p>
