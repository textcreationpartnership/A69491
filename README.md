1. GESTƲS EƲCHARISTICƲS.

    _ Object. 1. That Geſture which our Saviour and his Apoſtles uſed, at the Inſtitution of this Sacrament, is moſt fit, and decent, and obliegeth all Chriſtians. So excellent and authoritative a Pattern hath the force of a Precept. Now, that our Saviour, and his Apoſtles ſate thereat, ſeems clear from the Hiſtory of the Goſpel; wherein we read, that they ſate at the Paſsover, at the cloſe of which Feaſt the Sacrament was inſtituted; and there is not the leaſt mention of changing their Poſture throughout the whole time that the Supper laſted. If the Apoſtles then
kneeled not, but uſed a Fellow-like Geſture with Chriſt, with whom they ſate at the ſame Table, is it not a great Hypocriſie in us, to pretend greater Reverence and Devotion in receiving it, than the Apoſtles uſed?

    _ Ob. 2. The Sacrament is called, The Lords Supper, by the Apoſtle 1 Cor. 11. 20. therefore a Supper▪Geſture, is fitteſt to be uſed thereat, which, amongſt us, is Sitting. Whereas in the Practice of the Church of England, there is nothing like a Supper. The Communicants neither eate nor drink together at the ſame Table, but receive ſome ſmall Portions of Both from the Hand of the Miniſter. Neither are theſe commonly given at the Table but carryed about by him that officiates, to the gueſts, who are in ſeverall ſeats, whereby the uſe of a cōmon Table is overthrown and the Communion deſtroyed. Clemens Alex. Strom. 1. witneſſeth of the time werein he lived, that when ſome had divided the Sacrament they ſuffred ever one of the People to take his Part.

    _ Object. 3. Religious Adoration before a Creature (eſpecially if conſecrated and ſignifying an holy Thing) with reſpect thereto, is Idolatry, except we have a ſpecial command of God for it. But the kneeling before the Sacramental Bread, and Wine is ſuch an Adoration, Ergo, &c. If it be ſaid, that the worſhip is given, not to the Bread and Wine, but to God, and his Son Chriſt, who are there preſent; the ſame excuſe will ſerve the Papiſts, yea the Pagans themſelves, who pretend to worſhip, not the Image it ſelf, but God in the Image. God cenſureth the Intention of the worſhipper by his outward
 Geſture, Jer. 2. 27. Neither is there any manifeſter way of idolizing any Creature, than to kneel, and pray before it. Hezekiah therefore not only removed, but brake in pieces the brazen Serpent, when it was abuſed to Idolatry, though it had been ſet up by Gods expreſs command, and was reſerved as a Monument of his great Mercy, and Power ſhewen towards his People. Laſtly, if there be no Adoration given to the Sacrament, but to God only, why is there not the like Reverence ſhewen at Baptiſme, which is a like Ordinance of Chriſt, and a part of his Service?

    _ Object. 4. Kneeling at the Communion hath at leaſt a great Appearance of Evil, and gives offence unto the weak. Many Godly Perſons are ſcandalized at it, and debard of the Subſtance (the Partaking of the Sacrament) for want of yielding to a Circumſtance, contrary to their Judgment, and Conſcience. Eſpecially, care is to be had of impoſing on the Faith, and Conſcience of ſo many Chriſtians at this day, who have been uſed ſo long to Liberty, and been ſtrongly
 prepoſſeſt with contrary Principles, though otherwiſe well-meaning, and pious. How many will be in danger of falling away unto the Sectaries, and deſerting the Church altogether, if rigorouſly preſt to Conformity in this particular? What good can there be imagined to ariſe from preſſing of Conformity, which may exceed, or equal theſe Miſchiefs? Beſides, what is indifferent in its nature, ought not to be preſt as neceſſary, but a freedom allowed both in Judgment and Practice.

    _ Ob. 5. This Geſture of kneeling at the Sacrament gives the juſter cauſe of offence, becauſe it had its Originall from the Pope of Rome; and (which is worſe) upon a very ill Ground, or ſuppoſall, viz. upon the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, whereon it was built; the ſcandalous conſequent of a falſe opinion. For when that doctrine was agreed on, and finally determined in the great Councill of Laterane, under Innoc. 3d. then, and not before, was this
kneeling at the Sacrament, ſome few yeares after, enjoyned by Honorius 3d. his immediate ſucceſſour, as a Geſture agreeable to expreſſe the Adoration which was due to the Body of Chriſt, corporally preſent in the Sacrament. Now how can that Geſture be fitly retained, much leſſe rigorouſly impoſed on all, which had ſo falſe, & unwarrantable an Originall?

    _ Ob. 6. At the Sacrament we put on and act the perſons of coheires and repreſent our ſitting with Chriſt at his Table, in his Kingdome of Glory, which requires a geſture of familiarity and fellowlike equality, kneeling then is very unſuitable, for it, as being a Poſture of Inferiority, Subjection, & Humility: Beſides, it croſſeth the aſſurance of our Coheirſhip with Chriſt becauſe it implies an unfellow-like and inferiour Condition in our future ſtate of Glory, and deba••s us from ſociall admittance and entertainment as Gueſts at his Table.

    _ Ob. 7. Kneeling at the Lords Table is contrary to the law of nature and decency, and to a Table of Repaſt. It is a private worſhip, during the publick▪ Beſides, the Elements which Chriſt conſecrated, and made choiſe of for the outward ſignes in the Lords Supper, are meane and ordinary, and therefore he cannot in any reaſon be thought to have intended any ſuch Adoration▪ or Reverence to be uſed at the partaking of them. Laſtly, the Euchariſt is a Feaſt of Joy and
Thanksgiving, and therefore a Geſture of Humiliation, ſuch as kneeling is, is improper.
